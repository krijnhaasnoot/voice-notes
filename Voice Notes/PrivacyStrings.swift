When you enable AI summaries, your transcripts are sent securely to the AI provider you choose (OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini).

These providers use your data only to generate summaries.

They do **not** use your data to train their models.

Providers may temporarily store data (max 30 days) for abuse detection and system safety.

You are always in control: choose your provider or use the app's default option.
